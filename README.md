Coding to databases—which often involves the use of boilerplate code that's difficult to maintain and debug—can be tedious work. Upgrading applications to a different kind of data storage is similarly challenging, as it usually involves massive code rewrites. Spring Data addresses these issues by abstracting data store interactions into a common repository API and eliminating boilerplate code.

In this course, learn how to easily implement JPA-based repositories using Spring Data JPA. Instructor Mary Ellen Bowman introduces you to the Spring Data umbrella project and covers a handful of commonly used querying methods that you can start practicing on your own. From simple query methods with property expressions to more dynamic options like Querydsl, Query by Example (QBE), Spring Data REST, and MongoDB, Mary Ellen helps you build the skills you need to leverage the features of this powerful data management tool.
